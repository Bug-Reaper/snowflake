This is a snowflake simulator written in python by Rachael Holmes and Giles Hall.  It builds realistic looking snowflakes by modeling the phase transistions between water molecules at a mesoscopic scale.  The model is lifted (verbatim) from "MODELING SNOW CRYSTAL GROWTH II: A mesoscopic lattice map with plausible dynamics" by Janko Gravner and David Griffeath.
